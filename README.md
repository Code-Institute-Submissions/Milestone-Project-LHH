## UX

### Strategy

Website goal:

* The purpose of this website is to bring the holiday homes to the public's attention and thus rent out the property more often and thereby earn more. 

User goals:

* Users looking for an overnight stay in a natural environment or in Winterswijk can find information about the holiday homes and assess whether it meets the requirements.
* In a positive judgment, users should easily find information about the booking process. 

### Scope

The website will have a minimalist character, so that the user can quickly and clearly find good information about the area and the holiday homes.
Visually, the site must be made according to the latest trends, so that the website stands out from the more standard websites of the competition.
All this in a way that suits my current skills. 


### Structure

The website will appear calm and visually appealing. There will be some beautiful natural photos of the area and some practical photos with the
properties of the holiday homes. There will be small paragraphs with catchy text and a minimal summary of holiday home characteristics. Only the features not as
standard will be included.
