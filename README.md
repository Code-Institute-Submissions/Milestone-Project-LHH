<h1 align="center">Lichtenberg Holiday Homes</h1>

[View the project live here](https://jbeskers.github.io/Milestone-Project-LHH/)

This is a website where you can find information about two holiday homes that are rented out by the Lichtenberg family and are located in the vicinity of Winterswijk 
in the Netherlands. Winterswijk is a beautiful area full of nature and where many activities can be undertaken.

On this website it is possible to view information and photos of the area and the holiday homes and to get in contact to make a reservation.

The purpose of this website is to bring the holiday homes to the public's attention and thus rent out the property more often and thereby earn more.

### Design

#### General

The website has a minimalist character, so that the user can quickly and clearly find good information about the holiday homes.
Visually, the site has been made as much as possible according to the latest trends, so that the website distinguishes itself from the more standard websites of the competition.
All this in a way that suits my current skills.

#### Colour Scheme

* The main colours used are black and several types of pastel yellow.


#### Typography

* The Poppins font is the main font used. Sans Serif is the fallback font.

#### Imagery

The website is calm and visually appealing. There is a nice natural background from the area and there are some nice photos with the
properties of the holiday homes.


#### Wireframes

The website consists of one page and has four sections.
